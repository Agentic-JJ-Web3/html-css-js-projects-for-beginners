# Code Snippet Manager

A simple and efficient web-based tool to organize and manage your code snippets.

## Description

This project is a single-page application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows you to store, view, search, and manage your code snippets. It provides a clean and intuitive interface for developers to keep their most-used code snippets handy. The application uses local storage to persist the data, so your snippets are saved in your browser.

## Features

- **Add, Edit, and Delete Snippets:** Easily create, modify, and remove code snippets.
- **Search:** Quickly find snippets by title, language, or tags.
- **Filter by Tags:** Filter snippets by clicking on tags.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Code is displayed in a formatted and readable way.
- **Dark/Light Theme:** Toggle between dark and light mode for comfortable viewing.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to work on different screen sizes.
- **Local Storage:** All your snippets are saved in your browser's local storage.
